The Colombian student visa is a Visitor type visa that allows the foreigner to stay, live and study in the country at an ***officially recognized institution or program*** for up to 2 years. 

Passport holders from [any of the short-term visa exempted countries or territories](https://www.notion.so/e9828c0103b340f998b5af161e146191?pvs=21) normally can study and take lessons or courses in Colombia as long as their stay in the country [doesn't exceed 180 calendar days](https://www.notion.so/Counting-your-days-under-Tourism-Permits-daa0b0c8e26743ca85b41dadb444b915?pvs=21), they can fully enjoy their educational experience without worrying about visa formalities.

If the foreigner comes from a different country, or if the program or course has a length greater than 6 months, the foreigner must apply for this visa to comply with the migratory rules. Also, consider that every school, university or institution may have their own rules for accepting students and are independent from the migratory rules.

If you are planning to apply for this visa category, you must make sure that the course or program you are enrolling to is officially recognized by the Colombian government at any educational level and that they will issue the necessary documents and evidence to attach for your visa application. The Colombian education system levels include public and private institutions for  elementary school, high school, University exchange programs, masters and doctorates. 

Also, some other programs and courses are recognized by the Colombian government such as language learning institutions, among others.  

It is important to note that the student visa is intended for individuals who will be studying **at least ten (10) hours per week during the whole duration of the program** and not for those who wish to travel to Colombia as tourists and take occasional classes.

<aside>
💡 When a school or University is supporting a visa application for a foreign student, they must comply certain migratory rules, specially, they must report the student’s enrollment and assistance to the classes. In that sense, if the student does not show up to classes, the institution must report this to the authorities, causing the cancellation of the visa.

</aside>

For second and further visas applications (even if they are not student visas), you will need to show evidence that you have successfully finished the studies program. 

This visa category belongs to the visitor type (V), meaning that it doesn’t allow the foreigner to accrue time towards residency.

Unless the program allow virtual or at-distance education, if the foreigner stays out of the country for more than 90 days it will cause the automatic termination of the visa.

## What are the benefits and restrictions for this visa?

### **Validity depends on the length of the program**

This visa allows you to stay and study for up to two (2) years, depending on the duration of the program.

### **No beneficiaries except for post-graduate students**

This visa does not allow applications for beneficiaries, except for postgraduate students.

### **Work permit only for post-graduate students**

This type of visa does not allow you to work in Colombia for Colombian companies, since it doesn’t have a work permit, unless you are enrolled in a postgraduate program, such as a Master, a Doctorate or specialization, in which case you will be allowed to work up to twenty (20) hours per week, provided that the employer reports such circumstance to Migración Colombia.

### **No time accrue towards residency**

Since it is a visitor-type (V) visa, this won’t allow you to add time in order to apply for a residency or (R) visa.

## Additional Requirements

### 1. ****Admission certificate****

Certificate of admission or enrollment in the educational institution indicating the degree or program for which the student is admitted or enrolled and its duration.

### 2. **The entrance stamp, its extension, previous visa or salvoconducto**

If you are applying from Colombia, you must show evidence of your current legal status in the country.

In most cases, this requirement is met by attaching your last Tourism Permit (Entrance Stamp), provided that it won’t expire during the 30 days of the visa processing. If you have extended your stay, you must submit your Tourism Permit Extension as well.

In other cases, you may already have a previous visa such as a student visa, if that is the case, you must attach it. 

In some other cases, if you have overstayed or your current visa is about to expire, you must go to Migración Colombia to get a Salvoconducto for a visa application, and attach it. Remember that there are two types of Salvoconducto: 1. To leave the country and 2. To apply for a visa. The one that you need is the last one.

If you are applying from your home country, you don’t need to attach any of the mentioned documents.

If you are applying from a third country, that is, not Colombia and not your country, you need to attach your residency visa of that third country.

### 3. A valid **health insurance**

You must have a health policy with coverage in the Colombian territory against all risks in case of *accident, illness, maternity, disability, hospitalization, death and repatriation*, for the time foreseen for your stay in the country. If you are buying a health insurance policy only for your visa application, get one in spanish. If your health insurance policy is not in Spanish, you'll need to have it officially translated.

There are different options to comply with this requirement. Some of the (cheapests) health insurance providers that have the required coverage include: Genki, Terrawind, Mok, Travel Assist, Qualitas assistance and Travelkit.

Your health insurance should cover you for at least one year. According to our experience, the visa authorities are setting the validity of the digital nomad visa based on the coverage period of the health insurance policy. Therefore, we recommend that you obtain a two-year policy if you want your visa to be valid for two years.

We recommend using [Genki](https://genki.world/) (although we have no affiliation with them). Genki has the required coverage plus: 1) has 2 years validity by default. 2) Can be paid monthly starting at 35 eur per month. 3) Can be cancelled anytime 4) The purchase is quick and online (one business day at the most) 5) They issue a health coverage summary in spanish (aswell as in engligh, german, italian…) 6) has been successfully used by many of our clients who have gotten their visas approved.

💡 **Consider that, according to the current visa rules, all documents produced abroad must be duly apostilled and officially translated by a certified Colombian translator. These documents can’t be more than 90 days old at the time of the visa application.**
