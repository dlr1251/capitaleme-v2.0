</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-and-restrictions-for-this-visa">What are the benefits and restrictions for this visa?</h2>
<h3 id="you-can-visit-the-country-for-up-to-90-days"><strong>You can visit the country for up to 90 days</strong></h3>
<p>This visa can be valid for up to one (1) year. However, the authorized permanence in Colombian terriotorio will be 90 days (continous or discontinous). Those 90 days may be extended for 90 more. In any case, after staying in Colombia for more than 180 days in a 365 days period (starting from the date the visa was approved), you won’t be able to use this visa anymore and you will most likely have to either wait for the next year or to apply for a different visa category.</p>
<h3 id="no-beneficiaries"><strong>No beneficiaries</strong></h3>
<p>This visa does not allow applications for beneficiaries, that means that each family member needs to apply for this visa separately.</p>
<h3 id="no-work-permit"><strong>No work permit</strong></h3>
<p>This type of visa does not allow you to work in Colombia for Colombian companies, since it doesn’t have a work permit.</p>
<h3 id="no-time-accrue-towards-residency"><strong>No time accrue towards residency</strong></h3>
<p>Since it is a visitor-type (V) visa, this won’t allow you to add time in order to apply for a resident (R) visa.</p>
<hr/>
<h1 id="how-to-get-the-tourism-visa"><strong>How to get the tourism visa</strong></h1>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.notion.so/General-visa-application-rules-1dc2c565143e4adb95086f993f184e36?pvs=21">any visa application</a>, the process is done online, through the Ministry for Foreign Relationship’s website. On this form, other than providing your personal, professional and family information and data, you will be required to attach some documents that evidence your tourism trip.</p>
<p>So, basically, you will be required to attach some documents that evidence that you will be staying here as a tourist and not using the tourism visa for other purposes, like looking for work, to study or any other activities that are better suited for another category of visa application.</p>
<p>The specific requirements for a tourism visa may vary depending on your sponsorship. If you are applying <strong>with the sponsorship of a Colombian host</strong>, you will need to provide documentation of your sponsor’s financial solvency and the sponsor’s motivational letter. If you are applying <strong>on your own behalf</strong>, you will need to provide documentation of your own financial solvency and a motivational letter.</p>
<h3 id="on-your-own-behalf"><strong>On your own behalf</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Motivational letter</strong></p>
<p>You will need to write a motivational letter informing your full identification (full legal name, passport number, birthdate, nationality and residency), explaining thoroughly and accurately the activities that you are planning to do under the tourism visa, including the address of where you will be staying (such as an hotel, hostal, etc), itinerary, participants, and any other relevant information that can give the authorities where can you be found, what will you be doing and with who.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of your financial solvency</strong></p>
<p>This can be accomplished by providing your bank statements from the previous six months, showing a monthly income of at least 10 Colombian minimum wages.</p>
<p><em>(As of 2023, the minimum wage in Colombia is $1.160.000 per month)</em></p>
<h3 id="sponsored-by-a-colombian-host">Sponsored by a <strong>Colombian host</strong></h3>
<p>You can get your visa application sponsored or backed up by a Colombian national or Colombian resident (a foreigner with a current valid Resident visa), if this is the case, you will need:</p>
<p><strong>Letter from your sponsor</strong></p>
<p>On this letter, your sponsor confirms that he/she will take full responsibility for your personal and financial well-being during your stay in Colombia, including covering all expenses related to transportation, accommodation and repatriation.</p>
<p>The sponsor needs to include his/her phone number, physical address, email address, the type of relationship with you (relative, fiance, friend, business partner, etc.), the manual  signature (on pen) and a fingerprint (one fingerprint) of either the right or left index finger, or right or left thumb finger.</p>
<p><em><strong>The sponsor also commits on this letter to inform the Colombian government if you stay in the country illegally and to ensure your return to your country of origin. Non-compliance with this rule may result in sanctions.‍ The sponsor also needs to state in this letter previously sponsored visa applications.</strong></em></p>
<hr/>
<p>Here are some sample letters for the visa application:</p>

<p><strong>Proof of the sponsor’s financial solvency</strong></p>
<p>Attach his/her bank statements from the previous six (6) months, showing monthly income of at least 10 Colombian minimum wages.</p>

<h2 id="additional-requirements">Additional Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="1-entry-and-exit-tickets">1. Entry and exit tickets</h3>
<p>You will need to show your entry and exit tickets for your visa application and at migratory control in the airport.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-photo">2. <strong>The photo</strong></h3>
<p>This requirement is one of the most underrated of all, since people tend to leave it for the last minute (showing great cultural adaptation).  This photo is the one that will go on your electronic visa once approved, which is why the authorities require that this photo be:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Recent, in color and with a white background: <em>Recent</em> means that you can’t use your current passport photo or the one from your previous visa. You need to take a new one.</strong>  (if you took this photo yourself from your phone, you can make the background totally white in this <a href="https://www.remove.bg/es/upload">website</a>)</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Neither hair nor accessories shall cover the head or face</strong> (no glasses, no piercings, no necklaces, no earrings)</p>
<p>✅ <strong>The face must be facing the camera and with a neutral expression</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>The head complete and centered</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Both eyes must be open</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>The size shall not exceed 300 kb</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>3x4cm jpg format.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/H54BvMgGknGVHeZGQFZ8OYNEKhsMe8jYKOKU1N5CkO3q8NrZQMAdKyZ7mln-0Kpx-OOXmurwY3qwH1--ioLWGJuHzjGQkIY9jvRYFg59_RU2KDcJVf_r1EFM633i3xCpuVLgw4Cjnhs">This is an example of how the photo should be. Remember: no accessories.</a></p>
<p>This is an example of how the photo should be. Remember: no accessories.</p>
<h3 id="3-the-passport">3. <strong>The passport</strong></h3>
<p>You must provide a photocopy of the frontpage (where your personal data is) of your passport, which, as mentioned before, must be from any of the short-term visa Exempted countries. Your passport must be valid for at least six (6) months beyond the date of your visa application. If your passport is only valid for less than six months prior to the date you’ll be applying for your visa, you must renew before applying.</p>
<p>If you have two or more passports, you need to apply with the one that you have used for entering the country previously or where you have had previous visas. Some people have used two different passports in the past, however, the Law says that at the Migration control you must inform the officers that circumstance. Notice that this may be deemed as “<em>inconsistent information</em>”, which is a common cause of <strong>visas denials.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="costs">Costs</h2>
<p>The total costs vary greatly depending on the circumstances of the applicant.</p>
<p>Here you will see an example of how much this can cost you.</p>




















<table><thead><tr><th>Concept</th><th>Other countries</th><th>Europe and Cuba (EUR)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Visa study</td><td>$54.92 USD</td><td>42.25 EUR</td></tr><tr><td>Visa issuance</td><td>$82 USD</td><td>40 EUR</td></tr></tbody></table>

<h2 id="application-process">Application process</h2>
<p>This process <a href="https://www.notion.so/General-visa-application-rules-1dc2c565143e4adb95086f993f184e36?pvs=21">is common to any type of visa application</a>, and includes the form submission, the payment for visa study fees and visa approval and registration, among other details. Please refer to the following list:</p>
<h3 id="1-submit-the-application">1. <strong>Submit the application</strong></h3>
<p>The application process is made online from <a href="https://tramitesmre.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites/enlinea/solicitarVisa.xhtml">this link</a>.</p>
<p>You can find a walkthrough guide (in spanish) in <a href="https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/visa-linea">this link</a>.</p>
<p>They will ask you about your personal info (academic training, current job, address, etc), family info, migration history in Colombia, and whether you have applied before, if you`ve had a Colombian visa before or if you have been subject to sanctions (in case you overstayed). Be transparent and don’t make typing mistakes!</p>
<p>In the last section of the form, you will find a table where you will have to upload your documents. Keep in mind: All the documents cannot be more than 5mb in total, so compress them accordingly. You can’t submit more than 35 pages in total. Check if any of your PDFs is secured with encryption and remove such protection.</p>
<h3 id="2-make-the-first-payment">2. <strong>Make the first payment</strong></h3>
<p>Once submitted your application, you will receive an email with an <strong>unique identification number (save this number, you will need it to track the visa status and to modify your application, if needed)</strong> of your process. In the same email you will get the instructions to pay for the study of the Visa which is $54.92USD or $42.25EUR if you are applying from Europe or Cuba.</p>
<p>You must pay within ten (10) days once you have applied. <strong>If you don’t pay in this period, your visa application will be not admitted, meaning that you will have to reapply.</strong></p>
<h3 id="3--respond-to-requerimientos-requests-if-asked">3.  <strong>Respond to “Requerimientos” (requests), if asked.</strong></h3>
<p>The authorities may ask you for additional information about your visa application. Such as the name of your employer, your address in Colombia, to clarify your relevant data or whatever they think necessary to “protect national security”.</p>
<p>It is important that these requirements are responded to as soon as possible, and that any additional required documents are attached. That is why it is important that at the time of submitting the application, you have all the required documents mentioned above, with the legal formalities when needed (notarization, apostille, translation…). This is because the authorities may give a short deadline to provide missing documents, and it may not be possible to obtain all the documentation within such short notice.</p>
<p>If you do not respond to the requirements, your visa may be denied or deemed inadmissible, although typically it is only deemed inadmissible. Notice that if your visa is denied, you will have to wait for 6 months to apply again for any kind of Colombian visa, and if is unadmitted, you can reapply right away, but you will have to pay again the $54.92USD.</p>
<p>To respond to the authority’s request, you will need to enter into the same form of your initial application and re-enter your passport data and fill the field of “Application registry number” with the Unique Identification Number you got in your first submission. Then you forward until the upload documents section and attach the required info.</p>
<h3 id="4-visa-approval-and-registration">4. Visa approval and registration</h3>
<p>According to the law (<a href="https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/Normograma/docs/resolucion_minrelaciones_5477_2022.htm#13">Resolución 5477 de 2022, art, 13</a>), the authorities will take up to 30 days to approve, reject as inadmissible or deny your request. If your visa has been deemed inadmissible, you can re-apply right away, if your visa is denied or “Negada”, you will have to leave the country in 30 days and wait 6 months to reapply.</p>
<p>You will get an email. If it is approved, it will have a payment link. You must pay the issuance fees <strong>($232 USD) within 10 days, otherwise the request will be archived and the visa denied.</strong></p>
<p>After that payment, you will shortly get another email with your beautiful visa in pdf format. Print it and save it in a good place.</p>
<p>After you get your visa, it is <a href="https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/Normograma/docs/resolucion_minrelaciones_5477_2022.htm#118">mandatory</a> to get registered at Migración Colombia as a foreigner and get a foreign ID card (cédula de extranjería), it will also be needed in order to open a bank account or hire local services (TV, internet, and so on).</p>
<h1 id="faq"><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>
<h3 id="when-should-i-apply"><strong>When should I apply?</strong></h3>
<p>The moment to apply depends on each individual’s travel plans. But keep in mind that this process can take up to 30 - 40 days.</p>
<h3 id="which-authority-is-in-charge-of-this-where-i-can-direct-further-questions"><strong>Which authority is in charge of this, where I can direct further questions?</strong></h3>
<p>The competent authority is the <a href="https://www.cancilleria.gov.co/tramites_servicios/visa">Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Cancillería</a>. Migración Colombia is another entity which is responsible for foreign registry, border control, issuance of foreign ID cards among other things but does not make the decision on visas.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-restriction-on-how-many-times-this-visa-can-be-used"><strong>Is there a restriction on how many times this visa can be used?</strong></h3>
<p>There is no restriction on how many times you can enter and exit the country during the vigency of the visa.</p>  </div> </div> </div> <!-- Sticky TableOfContents --> <div class="sticky top-0 h-screen "> <div class="h-full overflow-y-auto">  <nav class="toc prose prose-a:text-slate-500 0 pt-20"> <ul class="list-none"> <li class="text-primary" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <a href="#foreword" class="toc-link" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> Foreword </a>  </li>  <li class="text-primary" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <a href="#what-are-the-benefits-and-restrictions-for-this-visa" class="toc-link" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> What are the benefits and restrictions for this visa? </a> <ul class="list-none" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <li class="text-primary" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <a href="#you-can-visit-the-country-for-up-to-90-days" class="toc-link" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> You can visit the country for up to 90 days </a>  </li>  <li class="text-primary" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <a href="#no-beneficiaries" class="toc-link" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> No beneficiaries </a>  </li>  <li class="text-primary" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <a href="#no-work-permit" class="toc-link" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> No work permit </a>  </li>  <li class="text-primary" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <a href="#no-time-accrue-towards-residency" class="toc-link" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> No time accrue towards residency </a>  </li>  <li class="text-primary" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <a href="#on-your-own-behalf" class="toc-link" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> On your own behalf </a>  </li>  <li class="text-primary" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <a href="#sponsored-by-a-colombian-host" class="toc-link" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> Sponsored by a Colombian host </a>  </li>   </ul> </li>  <li class="text-primary" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <a href="#additional-requirements" class="toc-link" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> Additional Requirements </a> <ul class="list-none" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <li class="text-primary" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> <a href="#1-entry-and-exit-tickets" class="toc-link" data-astro-cid-zekvapgs> 1.
